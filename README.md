## Submission Requirements
- Must print only `ඞ amogus`
- Should be named `ඞ.<extension>`
  - I.E, `ඞ.py, ඞ.rs, ඞ.c, etc`
- The language you used, added to `LANGLIST.md`, preferably in alphabetical order.
  - Will still merge without it, but it would be great if you can do it.
- Joke submissions should go in the `joke` folder.
  - I.E: non-programming languages and/or twisting of the rules.
- Non-joke submissions should go in the `lang` folder.

We will request changes on your submission if: 
  - These conditions aren't met.
  - We find it's not suitable for the repository in its current state.

**If your submission is offensive in any way, it will be denied on sight, without hesitation.**
