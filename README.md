## Submission Requirements
- Must print only `ඞ amogus`
- Must be named `ඞ.<extension>`
  - I.E, `ඞ.py, ඞ.rs, ඞ.c, etc`
- The language you used, added to the `Languages` section of `README.md`, preferably in alphabetical order.
  - Will still merge without it, but it would be great if you can do it.
- Joke submissions (anything that isn't a programming language) should go in the `joke` folder.
